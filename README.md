# README

Hi! I am here to catalogue all of my solutions to Project Euler prolbems that I have solved. This is a work in progress, but I hope to give a helping hand to people stuck on some problems.

## Sections

Each problem will be split into 3 sections

### 1: Hints

Each problem will have hints for both how to solve it and some optimizations to make your code run faster. **Note: To not spoil yourself when looking at the hints, each will be enciphered in rot13, which you can decipher at https://rot13.com/.**

### 2: Solution

Each problem will be given an in-depth method to reach the solution. **These also will be enciphered in rot13, which you can decipher at https://rot13.com/.**

### 3: Code

Almost every problem rquires code to solve it, so there will be a given Python code that returns the answer quickly.


**Now have fun coding! Any feedback is welcome!**
